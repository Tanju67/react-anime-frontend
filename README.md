# R-Anime

[View Demo here](https://r-anime.onrender.com)

An anime application built with React JS for the frontend and Express JS and Mongoose for the backend by using [Jikan REST API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/).The user can search for anime movies and series and filter the search based on certain values. The user can also see details about the anime, such as anime characters, voice actors, anime reviews, anime episodes and summaries. Additionally, after logging in, the user can add any anime they want to the watchlist. I created a [REST API](https://github.com/Tanju67/react-anime-backend.git) for the backend of this application.

â›” Jikan API let me to send 3 request per second. Therefore please wait for at least 1 second or the page upload before refreshing the page or navigating other page.
